Research Experience
======
* University of Chicago, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics
  * Biophysics of diabetes investigated using live cell fluorescence microscopy, December 2013 – Present
  * Principle Investigator: Dr. Norbert Scherer, Professor of Chemistry
  * Collaborators: Dr. Louis Philipson, Professor of Medicine; Dr. Aaron Dinner, Professor of Chemistry
  * Research Summary:  My research involves understanding the origins of diabetes at a cellular level. Previous research indicates that some cases of diabetes may be cause by abnormal insulin trafficking in pancreatic beta cells. To further understand the origins of the disease, I use live cell confocal microscopy to image the trafficking of insulin granules. I apply tracking software to obtain trajectories of the motion of granules over time. These trajectories are used to model beta cell behavior under different conditions or stresses. Additionally, I am developing new fluorescent microscope technologies to track cellular structures in 3-D. These technologies increase the axial field of view and resolution of the insulin tracking.

* University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
  * Live cell fluorescence microscopy methods for studying nuclear protein dynamics, December 2009 – December 2013  	
  * Principle Investigator: Dr. Chris Fecko, Assistant Professor of Chemistry
  * Research Summary: My research focused on using multiphoton fluorescence microscopy techniques to interrogate DNA-protein interactions in live cells.  I developed and characterized a method for creating two-photon photolesions on DNA in live cells as localized binding sites for DNA repair enzymes.  My research used the specialized polytene cells of the Drosophila melanogaster larva salivary glands.  In these cells, I demonstrated the recruitment of the enzyme topoisomerase I tagged with GFP to the site of DNA damage.  Furthermore, I developed a live cell fluorescence recovery after photobleaching method and model to quantitatively measure diffusion and binding of proteins.  The model takes into account fluorophore photophysics to more accurately determine protein diffusion rates and the nature of diffusion in disordered systems such as cells.  I found that the primary source of anomalous diffusive behavior in cell nuclei for GFP is the dense chromatin network.  Finally, I investigated how large protein complexes diffuse in live cells and the quantitative behavior of topoisomerase I recruitment to sites of DNA damage.  

* Alderson Broaddus University and WV-INBRE
  * Ovarian & prostate cancer suppression by VEGF inhibition with flavonoids, May 2007 – August 2007; January 2008 – August 2008
  * Principle Investigator: Dr. Yi Charlie Chen, Associate Professor of Biology
  * Research Summary:  My research studied ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines that were resistant to cisplatin, the cancer drug commonly used to treat these cancers.  Our group focused on flavonoids, a class of antioxidant phytochemicals, thought to be one of the active chemical agents responsible for the link between diets high in fruit and vegetable consumption and the reduced risk of cancer.  We looked at two possible methods for the use of flavonoids.  First, we measured the flavonoids' suppression of cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels to support the developing tumor.  Secondly, we looked at the interaction of flavonoids with cisplatin to enhance the effectiveness of cisplatin in inducing apoptosis in cell lines mostly resistant to cisplatin. We found that a particular flavonoid, kaempferol, limited angiogenesis in ovarian cancer cells and enhanced cisplatin's effectiveness in producing apoptosis.

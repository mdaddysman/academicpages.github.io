I was the instructor of record for fall 2013 physical chemistry computational lab (Chem 481L) course at UNC. The course involved preforming numerical calculations of quantum mechanical and thermodynamic problems. I prepare the course materials, conducted lectures, and wrote and graded exams and lab reports. Additionally, I supervised two teaching assistants who assisted in grading and managing office help hours. The course enrolled 40 senior chemistry majors. I was previously a teaching assistant in the same course in the fall 2011 & spring 2012. I received the 2012 Albert R. Ledoux Teaching Award for this TA assignment.
